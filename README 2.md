>While Sandbox has not made clear their target audience, research shows that 90% of metaverse related conversations are held by `Millennials and GenZ`, so it would be wise to assume those as a target. 

>`The marketsize for fintech is rapidly growing; however, it is unlikely that this company will attract inidividuals who are not interested in the gaming aspect of Sandbox as this seems to be a large feature of the company.` 

>As the Sandbox `has been around now for 10 years`, this does give a strong headstart amongst their competetion. They are also taking to popular culture forming `strong relationships with public figures and brands` to heavily market themselves.

They are also leveraging the rapidly growing marketplace, `opensea`, to attract investors who would not otherwise use Sandbox products or services. More recently the concept `"play-to-earn"` has grown in popularity, a concept in which this company seems to be encompassing as one of their primary utilizations.
